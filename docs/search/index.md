Search is a technique that enumerates the state space, finds the optimal solution by exhausting all the possibilities, or counts the number of legal solutions.

There are many ways to optimize search, such as reducing the state space, changing the search order, pruning, etc.

Search is the basis of some advanced algorithms. In OI, pure searching is often a method to get partial points, but there are very few topics that you can get full marks for through pure search.
